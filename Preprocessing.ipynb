According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed space-themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.\\nAs Kiwi was once fitted with machine-learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.\\nThe authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92 % had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.\\nCameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84 % on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90 % accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.\\nLead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. \\n“Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting.”\\n“This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real-time recognition and response to disengagement in order to re-engage the child to continue with the educational and/or therapeutic activity,” he stated.\\nFrom left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co-authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matarić’s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.\\nHaotian mai\\nAround one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction (ASD), can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.\\nCo-author Maja Matarić Maja J Matarić, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek:\\n“We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR [socially assistive robotics] for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non-threatening.”\\nJain stated: “Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and real-world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI [human-robot interaction] capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD.\\n“Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to long-term in-home knowledge with youngsters with ASD. “\\nAsked why the kids’s engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matarić stated: “The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts.”\\nHowever, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matarić stated.\\n“The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions,” Matarić explained. “Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kid’s particular wishes.”\\nShare This To World:TweetWhatsApp \\n\\n← Vogue fashion, 21, whose mysterious half-naked 4am balcony fall shattered bones all over her body finally takes first step\\nExclusive: Levi’s introduces paid family leave for workers →\\n\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n \\nLast Minute New Orleans Hotel and Flight Package Offers\\n\\n\\n February 21, 2020February 21, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nAccused Marie Yovanovitch ‘Stalker’ Robert Hyde Now Supplying Documents to Congress\\n\\n\\n February 12, 2020February 12, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nWho Won the Tenth Democratic Debate in South Carolina?

Invitiamo chiunque voglia sottoscrivere questa lettera a lasciare un commento a questo link seguendo le istruzioni.\\ndi ASSOCIAZIONE AIRICERCA \\n\\n\\n \\nWe are a group of Italian researchers who want to share our concerns on the COVID-19 pandemic on behalf of the International Association of Italian Researchers (AIRIcerca). We are particularly involved as Italy is currently the second most affected country worldwide, and we feel it is our duty to raise further awareness amongst academics over the apparent lack of appropriate countermeasures to the spread of the Coronavirus in several countries.\\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy dates back to February 21, 2020, when the first sixteen “Italian” cases were confirmed, triggering the introduction of restrictive measures to attempt containing the disease in eleven municipalities in northern Italy. In the following days, a rapid increase in the number of infected individuals, as well as the first deaths related to COVID-19 drove both local authorities and the central government to raise the alert level. The escalation of the epidemic and the impact on public and private hospitals finally led to two drastic decisions, mirroring in part the ones enforced by the government of the People’s Republic of China. First, Lombardy and several provinces in Northern and Central Italy were placed under quarantine in the early hours of March 8, 2020. Then, the quarantine was extended to the whole country the next day. On March 11, further measures limiting social contact and commercial activities were adopted, while ensuring access to pharmacies, grocery stores, and other basic services.\\nAt the time this letter is being drafted, the most recent reports from Italy confirm a total number of 15113 COVID-19 cases, of which 1258 patients were declared healed, while the death toll has climbed to 1016 (650 in the last 4 days). Regardless of the discrepancies between the criteria followed in different countries to test individuals with symptoms or at risk, the current projections for Italy are well above the earlier estimate of a case fatality rate in the range of 2%. The high number (1153) of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) depicts a reality of immense pressure on hospitals explained by the unusual virulence of the disease, able to cause severe respiratory ailments even in young subjects (contrary to the popular belief that initially downplayed the risks associated to the virus).\\nDespite fake news, short-sighted or ill-advised evaluations of the impact of the disease, and the dramatic perspective of a global recession, Italians have come to terms with the need for strong actions aimed to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system. So far, the emergency has hit parts of Italy endowed with a high-quality health system according to the last, albeit dated, World Health Organization (WHO) performance ranking (https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf), as well as to more recent reports (https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/reader/pii/S0168851019302593/pdf) which ranked healthcare systems by utilizing multiple indicators. However, the potential spread of COVID-19 to less prepared areas not only in Italy, but in Europe as a whole, makes the outlook even grimmer. COVID-19 transmission rates have been growing steadily also in Spain, France and Germany, among other countries. Despite the earlier misperception of an Italian problem, other regions in Europe and in the USA are now witnessing a trend in the number of cases that matches the progression observed in Italy, with a delay of a few days. \\nThe WHO has praised those countries that have taken firm initiatives to contain the disease, and the available data support this stance. In mainland China, March 11 marked the seventh consecutive day without new cases in the Hubei province, the original epicenter of the pandemic (8 new cases were reported on March 12, though). Similarly, roughly two weeks of quarantine have resulted in a sensible reduction of new cases in Vò (Padua) and in the Lodi province in Lombardy. In light of the Italian experience, the indecisive and uncoordinated response in Europe is for us a source of concern and befuddlement.\\nIn this regard, the decision to close schools and universities in Italy is commendable and similar restrictions may be advisable in the immediate future also in other countries. Earlier today France called for the same actions starting next Monday. This decision makes us hopeful that more countries will follow suit. The adoption of a proactive approach consisting in strong, uniform sets of rules regarding social habits and interpersonal interactions can produce tangible benefits.\\nWe are disconcerted by the inaction of a number of governments, many of which have so far merely introduced restrictions on the maximum number of attendees allowed at public events. We are also puzzled by the wait-and-see attitude of the University sector in several countries, where academic institutions continue in most cases to operate in a “business as usual” mode at this time.\\nThe greatest priority must be the preservation of public health. Clearer actions must follow urgently. We believe that the authorities overseeing healthcare systems should focus on communicating and enforcing rigorous rules and norms to be followed to prevent and limit the spread and diffusion of the virus, in order to ensure effective responses by hospitals, clinics and primary doctors as well. Describing COVID-19 as a “stronger than usual flu” is an easy but extremely dangerous temptation, and we oppose views that may be misinterpreted and lead the populace to downplay the impact of the disease on the ICU systems worldwide. While mortality rates may be relatively low (and we wholeheartedly hope that numbers will soon improve in Italy) and protecting categories at risk, such as elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, may be enough to cope with coronavirus successfully, we are worried by the progressive breakdown of our hospital systems. Given the percentage of COVID-19 cases requiring critical care for extended periods, assuming that any country will be able to handle a significant peak of COVID-19 is a risky proposition. In Italy, despite a number of ICU beds above the EU average (12.5 beds / 100000 inhabitants vs. 11.5), intensive care doctors and nurses have been dealing with never-ending shifts, and there is a shortage of beds and ventilators for all the patients requiring critical care in affected communities.\\nFurthermore, we are also worried that the decisions adopted to manage the emergency in the short-term will likely have severe long-term implications for our societies by wearing out the trust among citizens and institutions, workers, and employers.\\nWe trust academics to act now and promote a science-based approach, aimed to reassure and guide citizens in the adoption of the best preventive behaviors, and to instill a greater sense of urgency in decision makers and legislators. The immediate goal of implementing careful and incisive initiatives is instrumental for the success of the collective effort against COVID-19 and for the safeguard of our healthcare systems and professionals. As scientists and academics, but most importantly citizens, we expect no less.\\nFederico Aletti, Assistant Project Scientist-Marie Curie Alumnus, University of California San Diego, San Diego,

But he gets the most fan letters about working with John Wayne in the western “Rio Grande,” the third film in director John Ford’s famous cavalry trilogy.“I can always tell when it has been on TV because I get a ton of letters about it,” Jarman said. “People still remember “Rio Grande” and you have a lot of John Ford and John Wayne fans out there. It was a great experience and really the highlight of my film career.”Jarman will be appearing at the Mid-South Film Festival this week in Olive Branch where he will sign autographs and share stories about “The Yearling” and “Rio Grande” and his days as a child actor during the “Golden Age of Hollywood.”\\nJarman was 10 years old and living in Nashville when he got the role in “The Yearling.” Director Clarence Brown and MGM conducted a talent search looking for an unknown actor to play the role of Jody in the movie based on Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings book.Jarman said Brown, who was from the South, visited different schools in Birmingham, Atlanta, Memphis, Knoxville, and Nashville looking for an authentic southerner for the role.Jarman was in the fifth grade when Brown visited his school on Valentine’s Day in 1945. “He came to my classroom and saw me and wanted to talk to me,” Jarman said. “I was at the chalkboard at the time. He asked me if I was interested in going to Hollywood to make a movie.”Jarman’s only acting experience had been in school plays and some community theater.“He ended up coming to my house later that day and wanted to take some pictures of me to send to Sydney Franklin, the producer,” Jarman said. “He said I had the look he was looking for.”Brown called back three days later and told him to come to Hollywood for a screen test. “The Yearling” would take nearly two years to film. Jarman said the movie, which was shot on location in Florida, was difficult to make because it required a lot of retakes.“I started when I was 10 and finished when I was 12,” Jarman recalled. “It took a long time because we were working with animals. There were times when we had to do over 100 takes because the deer wouldn’t follow. You can’t train a deer. You just had to keep doing it over and over and over.”Jarman said Brown was a lot of fun to work with. He would take him on walks every night to prepare him for the next day of shooting.“He was very nice to me,” Jarman said.Jarman also has fond memories of co-star Gregory Peck, who he said was fabulous to work with.  “He had only just started his career,” Jarman said. “He had been in “The Keys to the Kingdom” and had just filmed “Duel in the Sun,” which hadn’t come out yet. He was a joy to work with.”Jarman lost touch with Peck over the years, but said he saw him backstage at the 1995 Academy Awards show where all of the past winners were on stage together.“I hadn’t seen him in 40 years,” Jarman said. “So I went over and said hello to him. He took me over to meet his wife and said ‘this is my son.’ He was just a wonderful person.”Jarman signed a five year contract with MGM and had his own dressing room, makeup man and wardrobe assistant. He went to school in-between filming on the lot where his classmates were other child actors like Elizabeth Taylor, Margaret O’Brien and Dean Stockwell.“It was a little two room school house,” Jarman said. “It was quite a group.”Jarman followed up “The Yearling” with “High Barbaree” in 1947 with Van Johnson and June Allyson, then starred in “Intruder in the Dust,” which is his personal favorite.The movie was directed by Clarence Brown and is based on a William Faulkner novel about a black man who is unjustly accused of murdering a white man. Jarman plays a teenager ,who along with the town lawyer and and elderly woman, try to prove his innocence.Jarman said MGM didn’t want to make the movie and quietly buried  it.“It was a movie that Clarence Brown, one of their top directors, wanted to make,” Jarman said. “MGM and studio head Louis B. Mayer did not want to make it. They weren’t making movies like that in 1949. They were making movies like “Meet Me in St. Louis” and all those musicals. They didn’t know what to do with it. They didn’t promote it and it never got any traction.”The movie was shot on location in Oxford, Mississippi. University of Mississippi made a documentary called “When We Were Extras” about the making of the film, and several extras who appeared in the movie will also make an appearance at the festival to share their memories.“The jail that you see, that was the real jail in Oxford,” Jarman said. “The people that you see, those were the real people of Oxford.”Jarman said “Intruder in the Dust” has since been rediscovered over the years and is now popular at film noir festivals where it has received the acclaim that it deserves.“That’s a movie that I am very proud of,” Jarman said. “It has a following now at film festivals around the country which is gratifying to me.”Jarman made a total of six movies for MGM from 1945 to 1950 including the westerns “Roughshod” with Gloria Graham, and “The Outriders” with Joel McCrea, Arlene Dahl, and Barry Sullivan.“I loved riding horses and being outdoors,” Jarman said. “But I really didn’t have much of a part and was anxious to finish it because I was supposed to go to Oxford for “Intruder in the Dust.” So that was kind of a throwaway movie.”\\nJarman said his least favorite movie with MGM was “The Sun Comes Up” with Jeanette MacDonald and Lassie. The film was based on another Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings story. MacDonald plays an opera singer in New York whose son is killed. She decides to move away and get a fresh start in the mountains of North Carolina where she meets an orphan boy played by Jarman.Jarman said the movie never lived up to expectations.“I think they were secretly hoping for a sequel to “The Yearling,”” Jarman said. “Everyone had high hopes for it, but it didn’t live up to expectations. Time Magazine said even Lassie was bad.” By 1950, Jarman said he reached a point in his career where all child actors find it difficult to make the transition to more adult roles. He left Hollywood and returned home to Tennessee after his contract expired to finish high school and took on only a handful of acting jobs.“It was a transition time for me,” Jarman said. “I was growing up. And the film industry was really changing. The studio system was shutting down and nobody knew how to do TV. I just wanted to finish school. I worked a little bit, but in Hollywood, they want to see you, and if I’m in Nashville they’re not going to call me. So I just dropped out of the movies.”One phone call that he did get was from legendary director John Ford who wanted him to be in his upcoming western “Rio Grande” with John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara. “Rio Grande” was filmed in Moab, Utah and would turn out to be his favorite movie making experience.“He called me about three weeks before we started shooting,” Jarman said. “He said he was making a cavalry picture and asked me if I had ever done any Roman riding before? It’s when you stand up on two horses with one foot on each horse. I said, no. He said ‘well, you’ve got three weeks to learn.’”Jarman said he, Ben Johnson, and “Dobe” (Harry Carey, Jr.) spent the next three weeks learning how to do the stunt.“Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. were both excellent horsemen,” Jarman said. “We went to some ranch and all worked together and I did it. When you are 16 you can do a lot of things.”Jarman said it was a once in a lifetime experience working for John Ford. The director had a stock company of actors that he used in all of his movies, but had a reputation for singling out a favorite actor who he was nice to, and one who he picked on mercilessly.Jarman said he became Ford’s pet because he learned how to ride Roman style, and that Ben Johnson got singled out for abuse.“I did the Roman riding so I was his favorite,” Jarman said. “I could do no wrong. The one who could do no right was Ben Johnson. Ben got the brunt of it. But, he took it in stride because they all loved him (Ford).”Jarman spent more time on screen with Maureen O’Hara than he did with John Wayne, but said both actors were very professional and fun to work with.“They were great to work with,” Jarman said. “Maureen was so beautiful and very sweet. Wayne was very professional and easy to work with. He always knew what he was doing. Being around all these guys and being able to ride horses, it was probably the most fun I had making a film.”Jarman also likes to boast that he was the first person to shoot Lee Marvin in a movie in the 1952 Randolph Scott western “Hangmen’s Knot.”“He is absolutely one of my favorites,” Jarman said. “I think it was either Lee’s first or second movie. He was quite a character. He was a former Marine and a tough guy, but he was hilarious and a real fun guy.”Jarman was senior at Vanderbilt University at the time when he got a call to come to Georgia to play a small role in what would be his last movie, Walt Disney’s “The Great Locomotive Chase” with Fess Parker.“I dropped out of that semester and had to make it up later to graduate,” Jarman said. “We made that movie in Clayton, Georgia, which is where they made that Burt Reynolds movie “Deliverance.” It was really the back woods. Walt Disney was there, which was interesting. And Fess Parker had great success as Davy Crockett and then went on to own hotels and a winery, and was a very successful businessman. I didn’t have a big part in it, but it was fun to work on.”Jarman eventually left movie making altogether, graduated from Vanderbilt, and then served two years in the Navy, where he worked in public affairs with movie studios who were making movies about the Navy. He got married and in 1960 moved to his wife’s hometown in Birmingham, where he worked for an ad agency. In 1963, one of his client’s, John Hancock Insurance Company, hired him to work in their San Francisco office.Jarman became involved with the San Francisco Film Festival in 1965  and helped grow the festival into a major cultural event.“I sort of kept my hand in Hollywood,” Jarman said. “I ended up running it for 15 years. It was great because we did a lot of tributes to distinguished filmmakers. It was very easy for them to come to San Francisco from Los Angeles. We had everybody up there and would do afternoon tributes to everyone from John Ford to Henry and Jane Fonda. It was a fun event.”He never was able though to convince Bing Crosby or Orson Welles to appear at the festival.“Bing Crosby always downplayed his acting skills,” Jarman said. “He said ‘nah, none of my stuff was any good.’ So he wouldn’t do it. And Orson Welles? I tried to get him to come. He called me and left a message and said ‘This is Orson Welles. I can’t come to lunch today or ever.’”Jarman returned to the screen one last time in a 1979 episode of the NBC TV miniseries “Centennial” based on the James Michener novel. He published a memoir in 2018 called “My Life in the Final Days of Hollywood” about his movie career.Jarman said he doesn’t watch much television today or go to the movies anymore, and has little desire to act again should the phone ever ring.“I can’t foresee that happening,” Jarman said. “So I don’t even think about acting. I can’t tell you what’s going on today with the movies. I’m not a fan of the big blockbusters. I still want to go see the new “Top Gun.” Movies like that I will see. But most of the movies they make today I’m not too interested in.”He does, however, enjoy attending film festivals and meeting fans of  old classic movies.“That’s why I come to these nostalgia festivals, because the people there really identify with that,” Jarman said. “You look at the crowd and they are people who are accustomed to going to the old time films and know them.”\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nSMS\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nSave\\n\\nTags\\n\\nClaude Jarman Jr.\\n \\nMid-south Nostalgia Festival\\n \\nOlive Branch, Ms\\n \\nDesoto County, Ms\\n \\nDesoto Times Tribune\\n \\nNews Source Of Desoto County\\n \\nMgm\\n \\nIntruder In The Dust\\n \\nJohn Ford\\n \\nJohn Wayne\\n \\nRio Grande\\n \\nThe Yearling\\n \\nGregory Peck\\n \\nLassie\\n \\nMaureen O'hara\\n \\nLee Marvin\\n \\n×\\nPost a comment as Guest\\nEmoticons \\n\\n\\n[smile]\\n[beam]\\n[wink]\\n[sad]\\n[cool]\\n[innocent]\\n[rolleyes]\\n[whistling]\\n[lol]\\n[huh]\\n[tongue]\\n[love]\\n[sleeping]\\n[yawn]\\n[unsure]\\n[angry]\\n[blink]\\n[crying]\\n[ohmy]\\n[scared]\\n[sleep]\\n[sneaky]\\n[tongue_smile]\\n[thumbdown]\\n[thumbup]\\n[censored]\\n[happybirthday]\\n[ban]\\n[spam]\\n[offtopic]\\n[batman]\\n[ninja]\\n[pirate]\\n[alien]\\nComment Text\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nPost comment\\n×\\nReport\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nReport Abuse\\n\\n×\\n\\nWatch this discussion.\\nStop watching this discussion.\\n\\nWatch this discussion\\n\\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\\n                        \\n\\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\\n                        \\nCancel\\nStart watching\\nStop watching\\n (0) comments \\n                            \\n                        \\nWelcome to the discussion.\\n\\n\\nLog In\\nKeep it Clean.

studying and social talents hope such era may just in the future help others with the developmental dysfunction.\\nThe learn about noticed seven youngsters with gentle to average autism take domestic what’s referred to as a socially assistive robotic, named Kiwi, for a month. According to a commentary by way of the University of Southern California the place the crew is primarily based, the members from the Los Angeles house had been elderly between 3 and seven years previous, and performed space-themed video games with the robotic virtually day by day.\\nAs Kiwi was once fitted with machine-learning era, it was once in a position to offer distinctive comments and directions to the kids in accordance with their talents. For example, if the kid were given a query incorrect Kiwi would give activates to assist them resolve it, and tweak the trouble ranges to problem the kid correctly.\\nThe authors of the paper revealed within the magazine Science Robotics discovered all the youngsters noticed their reasoning talents support. Some 92 % had higher social talents after enjoying with Kiwi for a month, in keeping with the commentary.\\nCameras hooked as much as Kiwi enabled the crew to additionally observe how engaged the children had been with the robotic, in accordance with the place their eyes had been taking a look, the placement in their heads, their speech and how smartly they carried out on a role. The crew discovered engagement ranged from 48 to 84 % on reasonable a few of the members, and Kiwi was once in a position to stumble on a disengaged kid with 90 % accuracy. That was once in spite of possible distractions akin to domestic home equipment, in addition to buddies and circle of relatives. The crew discovered members had been maximum engaged in an instant after the robotic had spoken, however this went down if the space lasted longer than a minute.\\nLead writer Shomik Jain, advised Newsweek the kids changed into much less engaged because the month went on. \\n“Examples of child behavior during these disengaged periods included playing with toys, interacting with siblings, and even abruptly leaving the intervention setting.”\\n“This served as a motivation for our work, which created models that could be used for real-time recognition and response to disengagement in order to re-engage the child to continue with the educational and/or therapeutic activity,” he stated.\\nFrom left to proper, lead writer Shomik Jain with co-authors Kartik Mahajan and Zhonghao Shi, all scholars in Professor Maja Matarić’s interplay lab, with Kiwi the socially assistive robotic.\\nHaotian mai\\nAround one in 59 youngsters within the U.S. have autism, in keeping with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People with the situation, often referred to as autism spectrum dysfunction (ASD), can to find it difficult to keep in touch and engage in the similar manner as neurotypical other folks. While therapists may give individualized products and services that assist to show such youngsters social talents, now not everybody can have the funds for this, the crew stated. As such, they sought after to discover the potential for plugging the space with robots.\\nCo-author Maja Matarić Maja J Matarić, outstanding professor of pc science, neuroscience, and pediatrics on the University of Southern California advised Newsweek:\\n“We and other researchers have been actively exploring SAR [socially assistive robotics] for children with ASD, because SAR has great potential in supporting the learning of children with ASD. Since we were one of the very few labs that has worked in SAR from its inception, we used our experience over the past 15 years to develop the robot that would meet the needs and interests of children with ASD while being safe and non-threatening.”\\nJain stated: “Currently, robots are restricted of their skill to autonomously acknowledge and reply to human conduct, particularly in ordinary customers and real-world settings akin to houses and colleges. Engaging customers is a key HRI [human-robot interaction] capacity in the past unexplored within the context of long-term, in-home SAR interventions for youngsters with ASD.\\n“Therefore this learn about is the primary to use mechanical device studying modeling to long-term in-home knowledge with youngsters with ASD. “\\nAsked why the kids’s engagement and studying stepped forward after interacting with the robotic, Matarić stated: “The objective of a socially assistive robotic, usually, is to serve within the function of a motivating and supportive spouse. In the particular context of this learn about, the robotic served to inspire the kids to do the maths workouts, and to make stronger them as they had been succeeding or failing throughout the ones workouts.”\\nHowever, youngsters with autism do not want robots to harvest the advantages noticed within the learn about, Matarić stated.\\n“The maximum healing results come from being concerned human interactions,” Matarić explained. “Parents, siblings, caregivers and buddies can successfully inspire and make stronger studying and remedy of kids with ASD by way of paying cautious consideration to what youngsters to find rewarding and encouraging, and specializing in the ones interactions, shaping towards the kid’s particular wishes.”\\nShare This To World:TweetWhatsApp \\n\\n← Vogue fashion, 21, whose mysterious half-naked 4am balcony fall shattered bones all over her body finally takes first step\\nExclusive: Levi’s introduces paid family leave for workers →\\n\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n \\nLast Minute New Orleans Hotel and Flight Package Offers\\n\\n\\n February 21, 2020February 21, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nAccused Marie Yovanovitch ‘Stalker’ Robert Hyde Now Supplying Documents to Congress\\n\\n\\n February 12, 2020February 12, 2020\\nadmin\\n0\\n\\n \\nWho Won the Tenth Democratic Debate in South Carolina?

Invitiamo chiunque voglia sottoscrivere questa lettera a lasciare un commento a questo link seguendo le istruzioni.\\ndi ASSOCIAZIONE AIRICERCA \\n\\n\\n \\nWe are a group of Italian researchers who want to share our concerns on the COVID-19 pandemic on behalf of the International Association of Italian Researchers (AIRIcerca). We are particularly involved as Italy is currently the second most affected country worldwide, and we feel it is our duty to raise further awareness amongst academics over the apparent lack of appropriate countermeasures to the spread of the Coronavirus in several countries.\\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy dates back to February 21, 2020, when the first sixteen “Italian” cases were confirmed, triggering the introduction of restrictive measures to attempt containing the disease in eleven municipalities in northern Italy. In the following days, a rapid increase in the number of infected individuals, as well as the first deaths related to COVID-19 drove both local authorities and the central government to raise the alert level. The escalation of the epidemic and the impact on public and private hospitals finally led to two drastic decisions, mirroring in part the ones enforced by the government of the People’s Republic of China. First, Lombardy and several provinces in Northern and Central Italy were placed under quarantine in the early hours of March 8, 2020. Then, the quarantine was extended to the whole country the next day. On March 11, further measures limiting social contact and commercial activities were adopted, while ensuring access to pharmacies, grocery stores, and other basic services.\\nAt the time this letter is being drafted, the most recent reports from Italy confirm a total number of 15113 COVID-19 cases, of which 1258 patients were declared healed, while the death toll has climbed to 1016 (650 in the last 4 days). Regardless of the discrepancies between the criteria followed in different countries to test individuals with symptoms or at risk, the current projections for Italy are well above the earlier estimate of a case fatality rate in the range of 2%. The high number (1153) of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) depicts a reality of immense pressure on hospitals explained by the unusual virulence of the disease, able to cause severe respiratory ailments even in young subjects (contrary to the popular belief that initially downplayed the risks associated to the virus).\\nDespite fake news, short-sighted or ill-advised evaluations of the impact of the disease, and the dramatic perspective of a global recession, Italians have come to terms with the need for strong actions aimed to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system. So far, the emergency has hit parts of Italy endowed with a high-quality health system according to the last, albeit dated, World Health Organization (WHO) performance ranking (https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf), as well as to more recent reports (https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/reader/pii/S0168851019302593/pdf) which ranked healthcare systems by utilizing multiple indicators. However, the potential spread of COVID-19 to less prepared areas not only in Italy, but in Europe as a whole, makes the outlook even grimmer. COVID-19 transmission rates have been growing steadily also in Spain, France and Germany, among other countries. Despite the earlier misperception of an Italian problem, other regions in Europe and in the USA are now witnessing a trend in the number of cases that matches the progression observed in Italy, with a delay of a few days. \\nThe WHO has praised those countries that have taken firm initiatives to contain the disease, and the available data support this stance. In mainland China, March 11 marked the seventh consecutive day without new cases in the Hubei province, the original epicenter of the pandemic (8 new cases were reported on March 12, though). Similarly, roughly two weeks of quarantine have resulted in a sensible reduction of new cases in Vò (Padua) and in the Lodi province in Lombardy. In light of the Italian experience, the indecisive and uncoordinated response in Europe is for us a source of concern and befuddlement.\\nIn this regard, the decision to close schools and universities in Italy is commendable and similar restrictions may be advisable in the immediate future also in other countries. Earlier today France called for the same actions starting next Monday. This decision makes us hopeful that more countries will follow suit. The adoption of a proactive approach consisting in strong, uniform sets of rules regarding social habits and interpersonal interactions can produce tangible benefits.\\nWe are disconcerted by the inaction of a number of governments, many of which have so far merely introduced restrictions on the maximum number of attendees allowed at public events. We are also puzzled by the wait-and-see attitude of the University sector in several countries, where academic institutions continue in most cases to operate in a “business as usual” mode at this time.\\nThe greatest priority must be the preservation of public health. Clearer actions must follow urgently. We believe that the authorities overseeing healthcare systems should focus on communicating and enforcing rigorous rules and norms to be followed to prevent and limit the spread and diffusion of the virus, in order to ensure effective responses by hospitals, clinics and primary doctors as well. Describing COVID-19 as a “stronger than usual flu” is an easy but extremely dangerous temptation, and we oppose views that may be misinterpreted and lead the populace to downplay the impact of the disease on the ICU systems worldwide. While mortality rates may be relatively low (and we wholeheartedly hope that numbers will soon improve in Italy) and protecting categories at risk, such as elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, may be enough to cope with coronavirus successfully, we are worried by the progressive breakdown of our hospital systems. Given the percentage of COVID-19 cases requiring critical care for extended periods, assuming that any country will be able to handle a significant peak of COVID-19 is a risky proposition. In Italy, despite a number of ICU beds above the EU average (12.5 beds / 100000 inhabitants vs. 11.5), intensive care doctors and nurses have been dealing with never-ending shifts, and there is a shortage of beds and ventilators for all the patients requiring critical care in affected communities.\\nFurthermore, we are also worried that the decisions adopted to manage the emergency in the short-term will likely have severe long-term implications for our societies by wearing out the trust among citizens and institutions, workers, and employers.\\nWe trust academics to act now and promote a science-based approach, aimed to reassure and guide citizens in the adoption of the best preventive behaviors, and to instill a greater sense of urgency in decision makers and legislators. The immediate goal of implementing careful and incisive initiatives is instrumental for the success of the collective effort against COVID-19 and for the safeguard of our healthcare systems and professionals. As scientists and academics, but most importantly citizens, we expect no less.\\nFederico Aletti, Assistant Project Scientist-Marie Curie Alumnus, University of California San Diego, San Diego,

But he gets the most fan letters about working with John Wayne in the western “Rio Grande,” the third film in director John Ford’s famous cavalry trilogy.“I can always tell when it has been on TV because I get a ton of letters about it,” Jarman said. “People still remember “Rio Grande” and you have a lot of John Ford and John Wayne fans out there. It was a great experience and really the highlight of my film career.”Jarman will be appearing at the Mid-South Film Festival this week in Olive Branch where he will sign autographs and share stories about “The Yearling” and “Rio Grande” and his days as a child actor during the “Golden Age of Hollywood.”\\nJarman was 10 years old and living in Nashville when he got the role in “The Yearling.” Director Clarence Brown and MGM conducted a talent search looking for an unknown actor to play the role of Jody in the movie based on Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings book.Jarman said Brown, who was from the South, visited different schools in Birmingham, Atlanta, Memphis, Knoxville, and Nashville looking for an authentic southerner for the role.Jarman was in the fifth grade when Brown visited his school on Valentine’s Day in 1945. “He came to my classroom and saw me and wanted to talk to me,” Jarman said. “I was at the chalkboard at the time. He asked me if I was interested in going to Hollywood to make a movie.”Jarman’s only acting experience had been in school plays and some community theater.“He ended up coming to my house later that day and wanted to take some pictures of me to send to Sydney Franklin, the producer,” Jarman said. “He said I had the look he was looking for.”Brown called back three days later and told him to come to Hollywood for a screen test. “The Yearling” would take nearly two years to film. Jarman said the movie, which was shot on location in Florida, was difficult to make because it required a lot of retakes.“I started when I was 10 and finished when I was 12,” Jarman recalled. “It took a long time because we were working with animals. There were times when we had to do over 100 takes because the deer wouldn’t follow. You can’t train a deer. You just had to keep doing it over and over and over.”Jarman said Brown was a lot of fun to work with. He would take him on walks every night to prepare him for the next day of shooting.“He was very nice to me,” Jarman said.Jarman also has fond memories of co-star Gregory Peck, who he said was fabulous to work with.  “He had only just started his career,” Jarman said. “He had been in “The Keys to the Kingdom” and had just filmed “Duel in the Sun,” which hadn’t come out yet. He was a joy to work with.”Jarman lost touch with Peck over the years, but said he saw him backstage at the 1995 Academy Awards show where all of the past winners were on stage together.“I hadn’t seen him in 40 years,” Jarman said. “So I went over and said hello to him. He took me over to meet his wife and said ‘this is my son.’ He was just a wonderful person.”Jarman signed a five year contract with MGM and had his own dressing room, makeup man and wardrobe assistant. He went to school in-between filming on the lot where his classmates were other child actors like Elizabeth Taylor, Margaret O’Brien and Dean Stockwell.“It was a little two room school house,” Jarman said. “It was quite a group.”Jarman followed up “The Yearling” with “High Barbaree” in 1947 with Van Johnson and June Allyson, then starred in “Intruder in the Dust,” which is his personal favorite.The movie was directed by Clarence Brown and is based on a William Faulkner novel about a black man who is unjustly accused of murdering a white man. Jarman plays a teenager ,who along with the town lawyer and and elderly woman, try to prove his innocence.Jarman said MGM didn’t want to make the movie and quietly buried  it.“It was a movie that Clarence Brown, one of their top directors, wanted to make,” Jarman said. “MGM and studio head Louis B. Mayer did not want to make it. They weren’t making movies like that in 1949. They were making movies like “Meet Me in St. Louis” and all those musicals. They didn’t know what to do with it. They didn’t promote it and it never got any traction.”The movie was shot on location in Oxford, Mississippi. University of Mississippi made a documentary called “When We Were Extras” about the making of the film, and several extras who appeared in the movie will also make an appearance at the festival to share their memories.“The jail that you see, that was the real jail in Oxford,” Jarman said. “The people that you see, those were the real people of Oxford.”Jarman said “Intruder in the Dust” has since been rediscovered over the years and is now popular at film noir festivals where it has received the acclaim that it deserves.“That’s a movie that I am very proud of,” Jarman said. “It has a following now at film festivals around the country which is gratifying to me.”Jarman made a total of six movies for MGM from 1945 to 1950 including the westerns “Roughshod” with Gloria Graham, and “The Outriders” with Joel McCrea, Arlene Dahl, and Barry Sullivan.“I loved riding horses and being outdoors,” Jarman said. “But I really didn’t have much of a part and was anxious to finish it because I was supposed to go to Oxford for “Intruder in the Dust.” So that was kind of a throwaway movie.”\\nJarman said his least favorite movie with MGM was “The Sun Comes Up” with Jeanette MacDonald and Lassie. The film was based on another Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings story. MacDonald plays an opera singer in New York whose son is killed. She decides to move away and get a fresh start in the mountains of North Carolina where she meets an orphan boy played by Jarman.Jarman said the movie never lived up to expectations.“I think they were secretly hoping for a sequel to “The Yearling,”” Jarman said. “Everyone had high hopes for it, but it didn’t live up to expectations. Time Magazine said even Lassie was bad.” By 1950, Jarman said he reached a point in his career where all child actors find it difficult to make the transition to more adult roles. He left Hollywood and returned home to Tennessee after his contract expired to finish high school and took on only a handful of acting jobs.“It was a transition time for me,” Jarman said. “I was growing up. And the film industry was really changing. The studio system was shutting down and nobody knew how to do TV. I just wanted to finish school. I worked a little bit, but in Hollywood, they want to see you, and if I’m in Nashville they’re not going to call me. So I just dropped out of the movies.”One phone call that he did get was from legendary director John Ford who wanted him to be in his upcoming western “Rio Grande” with John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara. “Rio Grande” was filmed in Moab, Utah and would turn out to be his favorite movie making experience.“He called me about three weeks before we started shooting,” Jarman said. “He said he was making a cavalry picture and asked me if I had ever done any Roman riding before? It’s when you stand up on two horses with one foot on each horse. I said, no. He said ‘well, you’ve got three weeks to learn.’”Jarman said he, Ben Johnson, and “Dobe” (Harry Carey, Jr.) spent the next three weeks learning how to do the stunt.“Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. were both excellent horsemen,” Jarman said. “We went to some ranch and all worked together and I did it. When you are 16 you can do a lot of things.”Jarman said it was a once in a lifetime experience working for John Ford. The director had a stock company of actors that he used in all of his movies, but had a reputation for singling out a favorite actor who he was nice to, and one who he picked on mercilessly.Jarman said he became Ford’s pet because he learned how to ride Roman style, and that Ben Johnson got singled out for abuse.“I did the Roman riding so I was his favorite,” Jarman said. “I could do no wrong. The one who could do no right was Ben Johnson. Ben got the brunt of it. But, he took it in stride because they all loved him (Ford).”Jarman spent more time on screen with Maureen O’Hara than he did with John Wayne, but said both actors were very professional and fun to work with.“They were great to work with,” Jarman said. “Maureen was so beautiful and very sweet. Wayne was very professional and easy to work with. He always knew what he was doing. Being around all these guys and being able to ride horses, it was probably the most fun I had making a film.”Jarman also likes to boast that he was the first person to shoot Lee Marvin in a movie in the 1952 Randolph Scott western “Hangmen’s Knot.”“He is absolutely one of my favorites,” Jarman said. “I think it was either Lee’s first or second movie. He was quite a character. He was a former Marine and a tough guy, but he was hilarious and a real fun guy.”Jarman was senior at Vanderbilt University at the time when he got a call to come to Georgia to play a small role in what would be his last movie, Walt Disney’s “The Great Locomotive Chase” with Fess Parker.“I dropped out of that semester and had to make it up later to graduate,” Jarman said. “We made that movie in Clayton, Georgia, which is where they made that Burt Reynolds movie “Deliverance.” It was really the back woods. Walt Disney was there, which was interesting. And Fess Parker had great success as Davy Crockett and then went on to own hotels and a winery, and was a very successful businessman. I didn’t have a big part in it, but it was fun to work on.”Jarman eventually left movie making altogether, graduated from Vanderbilt, and then served two years in the Navy, where he worked in public affairs with movie studios who were making movies about the Navy. He got married and in 1960 moved to his wife’s hometown in Birmingham, where he worked for an ad agency. In 1963, one of his client’s, John Hancock Insurance Company, hired him to work in their San Francisco office.Jarman became involved with the San Francisco Film Festival in 1965  and helped grow the festival into a major cultural event.“I sort of kept my hand in Hollywood,” Jarman said. “I ended up running it for 15 years. It was great because we did a lot of tributes to distinguished filmmakers. It was very easy for them to come to San Francisco from Los Angeles. We had everybody up there and would do afternoon tributes to everyone from John Ford to Henry and Jane Fonda. It was a fun event.”He never was able though to convince Bing Crosby or Orson Welles to appear at the festival.“Bing Crosby always downplayed his acting skills,” Jarman said. “He said ‘nah, none of my stuff was any good.’ So he wouldn’t do it. And Orson Welles? I tried to get him to come. He called me and left a message and said ‘This is Orson Welles. I can’t come to lunch today or ever.’”Jarman returned to the screen one last time in a 1979 episode of the NBC TV miniseries “Centennial” based on the James Michener novel. He published a memoir in 2018 called “My Life in the Final Days of Hollywood” about his movie career.Jarman said he doesn’t watch much television today or go to the movies anymore, and has little desire to act again should the phone ever ring.“I can’t foresee that happening,” Jarman said. “So I don’t even think about acting. I can’t tell you what’s going on today with the movies. I’m not a fan of the big blockbusters. I still want to go see the new “Top Gun.” Movies like that I will see. But most of the movies they make today I’m not too interested in.”He does, however, enjoy attending film festivals and meeting fans of  old classic movies.“That’s why I come to these nostalgia festivals, because the people there really identify with that,” Jarman said. “You look at the crowd and they are people who are accustomed to going to the old time films and know them.”\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nSMS\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nSave\\n\\nTags\\n\\nClaude Jarman Jr.\\n \\nMid-south Nostalgia Festival\\n \\nOlive Branch, Ms\\n \\nDesoto County, Ms\\n \\nDesoto Times Tribune\\n \\nNews Source Of Desoto County\\n \\nMgm\\n \\nIntruder In The Dust\\n \\nJohn Ford\\n \\nJohn Wayne\\n \\nRio Grande\\n \\nThe Yearling\\n \\nGregory Peck\\n \\nLassie\\n \\nMaureen O'hara\\n \\nLee Marvin\\n \\n×\\nPost a comment as Guest\\nEmoticons \\n\\n\\n[smile]\\n[beam]\\n[wink]\\n[sad]\\n[cool]\\n[innocent]\\n[rolleyes]\\n[whistling]\\n[lol]\\n[huh]\\n[tongue]\\n[love]\\n[sleeping]\\n[yawn]\\n[unsure]\\n[angry]\\n[blink]\\n[crying]\\n[ohmy]\\n[scared]\\n[sleep]\\n[sneaky]\\n[tongue_smile]\\n[thumbdown]\\n[thumbup]\\n[censored]\\n[happybirthday]\\n[ban]\\n[spam]\\n[offtopic]\\n[batman]\\n[ninja]\\n[pirate]\\n[alien]\\nComment Text\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nPost comment\\n×\\nReport\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nReport Abuse\\n\\n×\\n\\nWatch this discussion.\\nStop watching this discussion.\\n\\nWatch this discussion\\n\\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\\n                        \\n\\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\\n                        \\nCancel\\nStart watching\\nStop watching\\n (0) comments \\n                            \\n                        \\nWelcome to the discussion.\\n\\n\\nLog In\\nKeep it Clean.
